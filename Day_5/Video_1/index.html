    The Cascade algorithm
    1. Position and order of appearance the order in which yout CSS rules appear
    2. Specificity : an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
    3. Origin : The order in which CSS appears and wehere it comes from whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authorised CSSS
    4. Importance : smae CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others especially with the important rule type

    // more preference will be given to the ID selctor and more than that to the inline style

    // inline style ex : <h1 style="color: blue;" class="yellow cred cpurple">CSS Specificity</h1>
    // inline style > ID selector > class or attribute selector > Universal selector
